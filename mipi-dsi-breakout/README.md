# mipi-dsi-breakout 

This contains multiple pcb designs for a MIPI DSI LCD screen test fixture. This project allows you to take "raw" LCD screen modules with MIPI DSI interfaces and connect them to a somewhat general purpose breakout board to interface with a microcontroller. The aim is to help prototype screens and capacitive touch screens before committing toadding these devices to your final PCB design.

## KiCAD Version

Current version: KiCAD 9.0.3

This was originally made with KiCAD 9.0.3.

## Description

This design optimizes for flexibility and ease of swapping out different screen modules for quick comparison between different parts.
